Description: Log shipper from systemd/journald to Logstash/Elasticsearch
 Journalbeat is the Beat used for log shipping from systemd/journald based Linux
 systems. It follows the system journal very much like journalctl -f and sends
 the data to Logstash/Elasticsearch (or whatever you configured for your beat).
 .
 Journalbeat is targeting pure systemd distributions like CoreOS, Atomic Host,
 or others. There are no intentions to add support for older systems that do not
 use journald.
 .
 This is the main package. It installs the journalbeat binary.
